# 🚀 C_plus_plus by Mansi

Welcome to my C++ practice playground! 🎮  
This repo is a collection of all the crazy, curious, and classic C++ concepts I've explored. From the basics to OOP, and from arrays to advanced pointers – it’s all here!

## 📂 What’s Inside?

🧮 **Array** – Initialization, reversal, and more  
🧠 **Function** – Natural sums, friends, and fun with functions  
🔐 **OOPS** – Dive into classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation  
🎯 **Pointers** – Single, double, wild, void – pointer party!  
🧪 **extern_program** – Linking files like a pro  
📚 **Miscellaneous** – Type casting, patterns, Fibonacci magic, and prime optimizations  

## ⚙️ Why?

Because learning C++ is better when it's hands-on. This is where bugs become teachers, and every `.cpp` file tells a story. 💡
